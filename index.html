            <p>Often times, when you consume something – say an apple – you notice its absence once you’ve consumed it. 
                You then experience the result of consuming it: you are less hungry. </p> 
    
            <p>However, when you consume electricity, you observe the results of consumption – for instance, 
                a charged phone or an air-conditioned room – but it is difficult to observe the work that produced these results. 
                You can see the outputs, but it is hard to keep track of the inputs, namely the electricity you use. </p>

            <p>That is, until the end of the month, when you (or perhaps the person in charge of your residence) 
                receives an electric bill. </p>
    
            <p>On the bill, your total electricity usage for that month is typically represented in kWh. 
                For example, it might say your household has consumed <span>900 kWh</span> in the month of July.</p>
    
            <div class="graphic-container"><img src="images/bill.svg"></div>
    
            <p>But how much is <span>900 kWh?</span> And more importantly, what even is a kWh? With nothing but a monthly total 
                of electricity consumption, it is hard to map daily activity to electricity consumed. </p>
    
            <p>This guide will help demystify the concept of a kWh, and hopefully make you more aware of 
                how much electricity you use on a routine basis.</p>
    
            <h2 id="breakdown">Breaking it Down</h2>

            <div class="graphic-container"><img src="images/breakdown.svg"></div>

            <p>When first learning about the kWh, the notation may be confusing.</p>
                
            <p>You may be inclined to think that the combination ‘kWh’ refers to kilowatts per hour. 
                After all, mph stands for miles per hour, or number of miles traveled divided by hours. 
                However, this is <i>not</i> the case for kWh.</p>

            <p>The kWh is actually a multiplication of kW and h. According to official SI naming conventions[1], 
                it should technically be written kW•h, where (•) signifies multiplication. 
                However, the representation ‘kWh’ has become a widely accepted shorthand.</p>
